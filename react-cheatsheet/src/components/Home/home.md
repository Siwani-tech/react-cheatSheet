## Install React

To get started with React, you need to have Node.js installed on your system.

1. **Create a New React App**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to create a new React app:

\`\`\`bash
npx create-react-app my-react-app
\`\`\`

Replace \`my-react-app\` with the name you want to give your React project.

2. **Navigate to Your Project**: Change directory to the newly created React app:

\`\`\`bash
cd my-react-app
\`\`\`

3. **Start the Development Server**: Run the following command to start the development server:

\`\`\`bash
npm start
\`\`\`

This will open your React app in your default web browser.

Enjoy coding with React!
